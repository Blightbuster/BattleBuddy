## Contributing Guidelines

- Please try to keep all commits as small as possible, with a meaningful/descriptive commit message. Keep them limited to isolated, logically-related chunks. If you have to fix a compiler warning and also update a string - do it in two separate commits. It makes reviewing, cherry-picking, and overall maintenance easier or everyone! :)
- If you have an idea for a new feature or want to fix a bug, please [Create an Issue](https://github.com/VeritasDev/BattleBuddy/issues) first to double-check that it is not already done, fixed, desired, etc. I'd love to have as many contributions as possible from the community, but don't want anyone to waste their time building a feature I may not want in the app or fixing a bug that is actually intended.
- Write unit tests, where applicable.
- Be smart about what files you create and where they live in the structure of the app - look through the project to see where it makes the most sense for it to reside.
- Until a style guide is adopted/created, please do your best to maintain the same code style, formatting, and quality as exists currently. There's nothing worse than tons of trailing whitespace, extra lines between functions, mismatching brackets, etc.
