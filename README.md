#  Battle Buddy
### The Unofficial [Escape from Tarkov](http://www.escapefromtarkov.com) Reference App

Concept and development brought to you by [Veritas](http://www.twitch.tv/veritas), with loads of help from his and the greater EFT Community!

***THIS REPO IS CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS! I WILL BE ADDING MUCH MORE DOCUMENTATION AFTER THE INITIAL RELEASE!***

## Project / Repo TODO:

- [ ] Setup Github Actions
- [ ] Changelog
- [ ] Figure out when Nikita will gib wipe
- [ ] Initial documentation

## Contributing Guidelines

- [ ] If you have an idea for a new feature or want to fix a bug, please [Create an Issue](https://github.com/VeritasDev/BattleBuddy/issues) first to double-check that it is not already done, fixed, desired, etc. I'd love to have as many contributions as possible from the community, but don't want anyone to waste their time building a feature I may not want in the app or fixing a bug that is actually intended.
- [ ] Write unit tests, where applicable.
- [ ] Be smart about what files you create and where they live in the structure of the app - look through the project to see where it makes the most sense for it to reside.
- [ ] Until a style guide is adopted/created, please do your best to maintain the same code style, formatting, and quality as exists currently. There's nothing worse than tons of trailing whitespace, extra lines between functions, mismatching brackets, etc.  

## <u>Backend v1.0</u>

- [ ] Remote functions deployed
- [ ] Fold server
- [ ] item update/syncing (every 60 mins)
- [ ] Total user count cache (every 5 mins?)
- [ ] Total ads watched cache (every 5 mins?)
