The game outputs stereo audio - a Left channel and a ChestRight channel, nothing more complex than that.

As your character's left or right ears get closer or further away from the source of the sound, the volume will change in each ear accordingly.\n\nWhen the tone is equally loud in both your left and right ears, your character is likely facing towards the sound.
