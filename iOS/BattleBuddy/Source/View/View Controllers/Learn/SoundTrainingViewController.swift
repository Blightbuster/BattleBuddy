 * What is this?
 * Have you ever had trouble locating where footsteps or gunshots were coming from? The sound training tool provides a way for you to practice your sound localization skills and get feedback in real time! Imagine you're blindfolded and can hear a sound nearby. The goal of this excercise is to pinpoint the location of the sound only by turning your head until you think the sound is directly in front of you.
 * How to use:
 * 1. Put on headphones
 * 2. Press "Start Training"
 * 3. You will hear a tone being played at a random location somewhere around you.
 * 3. Swipe left or right, just like you would move your mouse while playing the game, to simulate turning your character around.
 * 4. As you turn, you will hear the volume of the sound in each ear change as the position of the sound relative to your left and right ears will change accordingly.
 * 5. When the volume of the sound appears to be the same in both ears
 *
 * Why not footsteps or gun shot sounds?
 *
 * In front or behind?
 *
 *
 * UI:
 * Start training
 * Swipe left or right, just like you would move your mouse, to simulate turning your character in game. Once you
